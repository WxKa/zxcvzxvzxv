Jupyter Notebooks

With Cursor 1.0, agents can now directly operate inside Jupyter — not just in one cell, but across multiple cells.


Agent in Jupyter Notebooks

That means the AI can understand your entire notebook context, create new cells, edit existing ones, and even restructure your workflow seamlessly.

This is especially powerful for data scientists, researchers, and machine learning engineers who frequently jump between code blocks, charts, and calculations.

Currently, this feature is available for users running Sonnet models, which are optimized for advanced reasoning and long-context understanding.

To use it, just open your notebook in Cursor, and the AI will start assisting you wherever it sees opportunities — whether it’s rewriting inefficient code, generating plots, or suggesting improvements.
